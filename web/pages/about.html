                </div>
                <p>
                    As the foundation of the web, HTTP is used to transfer data 
                    between servers and browsers, allowing users to access internet 
                    resources. Among the numerous requests handled independently, 
                    using URIs (addresses) to locate resources such as pages, images, 
                    and files, HTTP has its own methods, each with a specific purpose. 
                    This protocol manages requests sent by websites, for example, 
                    and the responses from servers.
                </p>

						<h3>GET</h3>
						<p class="what-is">What is it?</p>
						<p>
							GET retrieves information from a resource on the server. 
							This entire website is only displayed to you because the 
							browser made GET requests for these pages to the server!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="cards">
						<h3>POST</h3>
						<p class="what-is">What is it?</p>
						<p>
							POST is used to send information to the server, 
							such as forms and file uploads.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="cards">
						<h3>DELETE</h3>
						<p class="what-is">What is it?</p>
						<p>
							DELETE instructs the server to remove resources from the server.
